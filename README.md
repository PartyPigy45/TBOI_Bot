# TBOI achevement bot

## About

This is just a still project that I made to test discord bot development. It matches any statement and if it contains the name of an unlock in Issac, it will post the image of the unlock note.

## Where are the images?

Right now I have two images that belong to Edmend in the repostitory as an example. However the raw images can be extracted and dumped into this project easily.  

## How to run

Assuming you have dumped all the unlocks, run `python3 add_images.py1` to add the background to them all. Create a .env file with the secret `BOT_TOKEN=` Then run `python3 main.py` on the host and the project should work.

## TODO  

- [ ] Make the search fuzzier
- [ ] Host the bot on github
- [ ] Improve logging
